Project assumption

Iteration 1:

    For Auth:       
    1.  Assume the auth_user_id and u_id are unique and will always be a positive number, and user id start at 1. e.g. if Emma is the 6th registered user, her u_id would be 6
    
    2. assume there is a series of global variables stored in database.py (users, channels, messages), with auth.py functions use and import them
    
    3. assume one user won't login twice, that is, user would not try login when he/she has already logged in

    4. assume auth_user_id is same as current user's u_id


    For Channel:

   1. Assume channel_id is unique and will always be a positive number, and it start at 1.

   2. Assume channel_name does not need to be unique.

   3. Assume the creater of channel will become the member and owner of this channel automatically.

   4. Assume inviter never invite invitee into the same channel more than once.

   5. Assume inviter need to login first to invite someone else.

   6. Assume user need to login first to join channels.

   7. Assume joiner never join the same channel more than once.

   8. Assume user need to login first to list channels.

   9. Assume channels_list and channels_listall only return channel_id and channel_name




    For Messages(for channel_messages_v1):
   1. Assume message_id is unique and will always be a positive number, and it start at 1.

   2. Assume each message should contain the message_id, channel_id, user_id, message_content, time_created.
